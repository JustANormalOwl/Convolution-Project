All works created here are open for the public to use and modify. Feel free to make changes and/or modifications
to this program. This program was made by owlthechill#3266 for the Deep Divers Industrial Diving Company, but you can
use it for other things too

This program is intended to provide a more in depth feel to characters.
You can set each item to a random value(unless explicitly told you can't) or a custom value.
If you have any questions, bring them to me at my discord owlthechill#3266
